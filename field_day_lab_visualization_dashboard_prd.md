**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project Name:** Field Day Lab Visualization Dashboard  
**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
Field Day Lab processes rich gameplay data—population, session, and player features—via a data pipeline that outputs both TSV files and API endpoints. Currently, stakeholders lack an interactive, flexible way to explore and analyze these data, slowing insights and feedback loops. A visualization dashboard will empower educators, designers, and analysts to rapidly surface trends, patterns, and anomalies in game-based learning data.

## 2. Objectives
- Deliver an intuitive, grid-based web application for visual exploration of gameplay datasets.  
- Support multiple chart types (histogram, bar, scatterplot, force graph, timeline) with the ability to extend in future.  
- Enable seamless switching between file uploads and API data sources per visualization.  
- Ensure responsive performance via local caching of API results.

## 3. Scope
**In Scope:**  
- Core visualization types: histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, force graph, timeline.  
- Grid-based layout with draggable/resizable visualization panels.  
- Data ingestion via TSV uploads and REST API fetch.  
- Abstract data-layer to decouple ingestion from rendering.  
- LocalStorage-based cache with expiration policy.

**Out of Scope (MVP):**  
- User authentication and role-based access.  
- Annotation or collaboration features.  
- Real-time streaming visualizations.

## 4. Key Features
1. **Multi-Visualization Support**  
   - Pre-built components for histogram, bar chart, scatterplot, force graph, timeline.  
   - Plugin interface for adding new chart types.  
2. **Grid-Based UI**  
   - Responsive, draggable/resizable panels using CSS Grid or a library (e.g., react-grid-layout).  
   - Save and restore layout configurations.  
3. **Data Source Selection**  
   - Per-panel selector: choose between file upload or API endpoint.  
   - Display validation errors for unsupported TSV schemas or API failures.  
4. **File Upload & API Integration**  
   - TSV parser with schema detection and mapping to feature sets.  
   - Configurable API client supporting pagination and filter parameters.  
5. **API Caching**  
   - Implement caching layer in LocalStorage with TTL.  
   - Cache invalidation controls (per-session or manual refresh).

## 5. Technical Requirements
- **Framework:** React or Next.js with TypeScript.  
- **State Management:** Context API or Zustand for layout, data-layer, and cache state.  
- **Visualization Library:** D3.js, Recharts, or Victory for core chart components.  
- **Data Abstraction Layer:** Adapter pattern to normalize TSV and API responses into a common format.  
- **Caching Strategy:** LocalStorage wrapper with metadata (timestamp, source, TTL).  
- **Testing:** Unit tests for components (Jest + React Testing Library); integration tests for data adapters.

## 6. User Stories
- **As an analyst**, I want to upload a session TSV file to generate a histogram, so I can inspect distribution of session durations.  
- **As a designer**, I want to fetch player features via API and view a force graph, so I can trace player progression.  
- **As a researcher**, I want to switch my scatterplot from file data to API data without reconfiguring axes.  
- **As a stakeholder**, I want the dashboard to load cached data instantly on revisit, so I save time waiting for API calls.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Initial dashboard load <2s; panel reconfiguration <500ms.  
- **Responsiveness:** Fully functional on desktop and tablet resolutions.  
- **Accessibility:** Conform to WCAG 2.1 AA for chart labels and keyboard navigation.  
- **Maintainability:** Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns; documented adapters.

## 8. Assumptions & Constraints
- API schema may evolve; data adapter layer must handle minor breaking changes.  
- TSV files follow a consistent feature naming convention; major schema shifts require manual adapter updates.  
- Users have modern browsers supporting ES6 and LocalStorage.

## 9. Success Metrics
- **Adoption:** 80% of pilot users regularly use the dashboard within two weeks of release.  
- **Performance:** 90th percentile API response (cached) <200ms.  
- **Satisfaction:** User satisfaction score ≥4/5 in post-launch survey.

## 10. Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1 (2 weeks):** Requirements validation, design mockups, adapter prototypes.  
- **Phase 2 (4 weeks):** Core visualization components, grid UI, file upload.  
- **Phase 3 (3 weeks):** API integration, caching implementation, user stories testing.  
- **Phase 4 (1 week):** Accessibility audit, performance tuning, documentation.  
- **Phase 5:** Launch and user training.
